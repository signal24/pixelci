# LLM Access (MCP)

PixelCI exposes a **read-only** API and a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server so AI assistants (Claude, etc.) can read build statuses, per-screen approval/rejection decisions, and review comments — for example to summarize what changed in a build, or to triage which screens were rejected and why.

Access is strictly read-only: an MCP client can never approve, reject, or comment.

## Authentication

Programmatic access authenticates with a **GitLab personal access token** (passthrough auth). PixelCI validates the token against your GitLab instance and maps it to your PixelCI user, so access is scoped to exactly what GitLab grants you — you only see apps whose project your account can access.

Create a token at **GitLab → Settings → Access Tokens** with the `read_user` scope (plus read access to the projects you want to see).

## MCP Server

The MCP server lives in `packages/mcp` and communicates over stdio. Build it:

```bash
yarn workspace @zyno-io/pixelci-mcp build
```

Then point your MCP client at it (e.g. Claude Desktop's `claude_desktop_config.json`, or `claude mcp add`):

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "pixelci": {
            "command": "node",
            "args": ["/absolute/path/to/pixelci/packages/mcp/dist/index.js"],
            "env": {
                "PIXELCI_API_URL": "https://pixelci.example.com",
                "PIXELCI_GITLAB_TOKEN": "glpat-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

| Variable               | Required | Description                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PIXELCI_API_URL`      | Yes      | Base URL of your PixelCI instance                                                                              |
| `PIXELCI_GITLAB_TOKEN` | Yes      | A GitLab personal access token (`read_user` scope)                                                             |
| `PIXELCI_VCS_ID`       | No       | The VCS integration id to authenticate against. Required only if your instance has more than one VCS provider. |

### Tools

| Tool               | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list_apps`        | List visual-testing apps you can access                                                                                                            |
| `list_builds`      | List recent builds for an app, with status and who approved each                                                                                   |
| `get_build`        | A build with every screen's comparison status, review decision (approved/rejected), comment, and reviewer                                          |
| `get_screen_image` | A screen's image as a PNG — the highlighted pixel diff (`kind=diff`) or the screenshot (`kind=new`) — so the assistant can actually see the change |

Once connected, you can ask things like _"In PixelCI, which screens on the latest build of app X were rejected, and what were the comments?"_

## REST API

The same data is available under `/api/ext` for non-MCP automations, using the same GitLab-token auth — send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (and `X-PixelCI-Vcs-Id: <id>` when multiple providers are configured):

| Endpoint                                                           | Description                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/ext/apps`                                                | Accessible apps                              |
| `GET /api/ext/apps/:appId/builds`                                  | Recent builds (optional `branchId`, `limit`) |
| `GET /api/ext/apps/:appId/builds/:buildId`                         | Build detail with per-screen reviews         |
| `GET /api/ext/apps/:appId/builds/:buildId/screens/:screenId/image` | Screen image (`?kind=diff` or `new`)         |

Reads are gated per app by VCS project access; a token can only see projects it can access in GitLab (unless the operator has disabled [`ENFORCE_VCS_PROJECT_ACCESS`](/deployment#access-control)).
