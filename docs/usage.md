# Using PixelCI

A walkthrough of the PixelCI web UI for reviewing visual regression test results.

## Login

Visit your PixelCI instance and log in via your configured OAuth provider (e.g. GitLab).

## Apps List

After logging in, you'll see your apps. PixelCI only shows apps whose VCS project your account can access — access mirrors what GitLab grants you. (Operators can disable this filtering; see [`ENFORCE_VCS_PROJECT_ACCESS`](/deployment#access-control).)

Click an app to view its builds.

## Build List

The build list shows all builds for an app, grouped by branch. Each build displays its status:

- **Needs Review** — new visual changes detected that need approval
- **No Changes** — all screenshots match approved baselines
- **Changes Approved** — all changes in this build have been approved

Click a build to view its screenshots.

## Screen Comparison

The screen comparison view shows screenshots from the new build alongside the reference build (the approved baseline on the default branch).

### Show Changes

Use the **Show Changes** toggle to filter the view to only screens that have visual differences. This helps you focus on what's changed without scrolling through unchanged screens.

### Show Diff

Enable **Show Diff** to highlight pixel differences between the reference and new screenshots. Changed pixels are overlaid on the image so you can see exactly what moved or changed.

### All Screens

Uncheck **Show Changes** to view every screen in the build, including unchanged ones.

## Reviewing Changes

When a build needs review, every changed screen has its own controls beneath the comparison: a comment box and **Approve** / **Reject** buttons.

- **Approve** or **Reject** each screen to record your decision. Type an optional comment first — it's saved together with the decision.
- Once you act on a screen it **collapses** so you can focus on what you haven't seen yet. Click it to expand again and change your decision.
- Reviewed screens show an **Approved** or **Rejected** badge, and the comment appears in the collapsed summary.

### Approving the Build

The **Approve** button at the bottom of the build is enabled only once **every changed screen has been approved** — a counter shows your progress (e.g. "3 of 5 screens approved"). A rejected screen blocks approval until you resolve it.

Once the build is approved:

- The build status changes to **Changes Approved**
- The failed CI job is automatically restarted via the GitLab API, and you're redirected to the pipeline page
- Future builds on the same branch will compare against this build
- Other branches that produce the same visual changes will be automatically approved (cross-branch approval matching)

### Carrying Reviews Forward

You don't have to re-approve the same screen on every build. When a new build is processed, any screen that was individually approved or rejected since this branch's last approval is **pre-marked with that same decision (and comment)** — as long as the screenshot still matches. Unchanged screens arrive already reviewed and collapsed, so you only review what's genuinely new.

## Build Status Flow

Every build moves through these statuses:

```
draft → processing → no changes
                   → needs review → changes approved (after approval)
                   → changes approved (auto-approved)
```

| Status               | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **draft**            | Build created, screenshots being uploaded                    |
| **processing**       | Comparing screenshots against baselines                      |
| **no changes**       | All screenshots match — nothing to review                    |
| **needs review**     | Visual differences found — human review required             |
| **changes approved** | All changes approved (manually or via cross-branch matching) |

## How Comparisons Work

When a build is processed, PixelCI runs a multi-stage comparison:

1. **Previous build on same branch** — checks if changes match a previously approved build on this branch
2. **Default branch baseline** — compares against the latest approved build on the default branch
3. **Cross-branch matching** — looks for identical approved changes on other branches since the baseline
4. **New screen detection** — screens not present in the baseline are flagged as new

Changes are flagged only when pixel differences exceed the configured threshold (default 1%). This approach minimizes false positives — once a change is approved anywhere, it's recognized across all branches.
