# Changelog

## v0.3.0

- Per-screen build review, with bulk approve and explicit build rejection
- Read access for LLMs/MCP via GitLab PAT, gated on project access
- Zoom for screens, including the diff overlay, with centring fixes
- Apps list search and screen review UX improvements
- **Fixed screen names being truncated on upload.** The CLI derived a name by trimming
  `sourcePath.length` off the front of each path, but `fs.glob` returns a _normalized_ path
  — so invoking with `./screenshots` silently ate the first two characters of every screen
  name, and a trailing slash ate one. Names are the screen identity (`{ appId, name }`), so
  this attached review history to the wrong record. Now derived with `path.relative`.
- Fixed new-build images being sized inconsistently with the reference build, and
  overscaled images
